# Godot Marching Cubes in C#

This is a project with an implentation of the popular Marching Cubes algorithm in C# for Godot.

 * Example.cs contains an example of how to use it
 * MarchingCubes/MarchingCubes.cs is the Marching Cube algorithm
 * MarchingCubes/MarchingSurfaceTool uses the MarchingCubes algorithm with the SurfaceTool to create meshes
 * MarchingCubes/SurfaceFunction is an abstract class determines the distance of any point from the surface

 ## Permsions

 Anyone can use this implementation for any reason. It would be cool for you to reach out and
 let me know what you are using it for, but it's not required to use it.
